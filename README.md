# Array task

Implement Array class which is a wrapper over an array of integer numbers.

1. Implement constructors that allow us to create objects of this type in several ways; 
2. Implement ``get`` and ``set`` methods if necessary (try to keep class immutable);
3. Override methods of the class ``Object``(``toString()``, ``equals()``, ``hashCode()``). 
4. No logic should be put in this Array class

The program should support the following operations:

1. done
2. done
3. done
4. done
Optional tasks:

1. done
2. Support for three options for filling array items: from the console, from the file and using random number generation.
3. done
4. Get all three-digit numbers with no identical digits in the decimal notation;
